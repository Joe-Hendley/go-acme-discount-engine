Legendary C# developer Juan Debb has written a DiscountEngine for the ACME store.​

Sadly, he isn’t very good at clean code. He is now living an assumed identity with a false beard.​

Your task is to clean this code up, following the specification and restrictions contained in rules.md. If the observable behaviour disagrees with the spec, preserve the behaviour.
